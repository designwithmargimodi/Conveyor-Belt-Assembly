⚙️ Modular Industrial Conveyor System Assembly

This repository contains the complete technical data, native SolidWorks files, and detailed documentation for a functional Modular Industrial Conveyor Assembly. The design focuses on robust material handling, ease of fabrication, and component standardization.

Project Overview
The conveyor system is designed to facilitate the reliable transport of goods in a production or logistics environment. The design prioritizes serviceability and structural integrity, utilizing a combination of standard purchased components (motors, bearings, belt) and custom fabricated structural members.

Key Design Features:

Modular Support Structure: Frame built from standard U-Channels and Metal Pipe legs, allowing for adjustable height and easy integration into various production line layouts.
Dual-Motor Drive System: Incorporates two asynchronous drive motors to handle the necessary power requirements for acceleration and load handling.
High-Precision Bearings: Utilizes Angular Contact Ball Bearings (DIN 628 - 7308) to manage combined radial and axial loads, ensuring stable shaft rotation and long service life.

Technical Details
Motor Specification Note
The design incorporates asynchronous drive motors (induction motors). These motors operate by running slightly slower than the synchronous speed of the rotating magnetic field, a difference known as slip. This slip induces the current necessary to generate torque, making them a reliable and highly efficient choice for continuous, industrial motion.
